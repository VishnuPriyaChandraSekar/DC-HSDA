# DC's Homelessness Navigator Backend
This is the backend for the HSDS API Java based implementation for DC's homelessness resource navigator. This proect will aim to closely match the published API endpoints of the HSDS API standard by Open Referral ([link](https://openreferral.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hsda/hsda/)), however there will be some deviations to the standard due to our custom needs and where they are, they will be published and made available.

To begin:
- Download the latest version of Java 10/jdk 10 from OpenJdk
- Install Postgres 10
- Install Maven 3.5.X (3.5.4 as of this writing)
- Your favorite IDE (strongly recommend IntelliJ)
- Clone this repo

For any discussions of this project, contact me on Asana or Slack (Code For DC's slack/#homeless channel), or open an Issue here.
