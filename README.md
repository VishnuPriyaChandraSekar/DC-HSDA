# DC's HSDA Implementation
This is the implementation for DC's HSDA, written in Java. This project will aim to closely match the published API endpoints of the HSDA standard by Open Referral ([link](https://openreferral.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hsda/hsda/)), however there will be some deviations to the standard due to our custom needs and where they are, they will be published and made available.

To begin:
- Download the latest version of open jdk 10
- Install Postgres 10
- Install Gradle 4.9.
- Your favorite IDE (strongly recommend IntelliJ)
- Clone this repo

In order to run this app, do one of the following:
 - Run `./gradlew run`
 - Open your IDE settings and follow the instructions from here - [Micronaut IDE documentation](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#ideSetup)

For any discussions of this project, contact me on Slack (Code For DC's slack/#homeless channel), or open an issue here.
